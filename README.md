**Project #7A - Windows File Sharing: NTFS vs Shared**

- The "Marketing" folder was shared between the regular Accounting staff and the Accounting interns. However, the folder permissions were configured to allow the interns to only view content and not to modify or delete files. 
- A folder containing secret HR documents was configured to give HR staff full control over the folder but have the contents of the folder be inaccessible by all other enterprise network users.
- A temporary folder called "Vendor Files" was created and configured in such a way that third-party vendors contracted by the enterprise could only upload files to the folder and not view, execute, modify, or delete anything else.
- A software repository folder was created and both regular IT staff and Senior IT staff were given full control over the folder. A licenses subfolder was created and configured in such a way to disable inherited permissions and limit access and control to Senior IT staff only.
